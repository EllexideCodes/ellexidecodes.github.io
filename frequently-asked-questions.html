  <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
  <ol>
    <li>What is the price of your profile layouts?</li>
    <ul>
      <li><b>I don't have a price, ma cherie.</b> I ask for my commissioner's budget range and work within those bounds. It is so that users are not completely emptying their pockets. I don't like the thought of people having a slightly heavy heart in giving their payment for the layouts I offer.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <li>Will you put in the same amount of effort for every profile?</li>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Unfortunately, no.</b> Making layouts take time, effort, and pretty much brain power to come up with a relatively unique design. As much as I love coding, business is also business. I <u>will</u>, however, make it as beautiful as I am able within the bounds of our agreement.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <li>Do you still make free codes?</li>
    <ul>
      <li><b>I do.</b> I have 3 different kinds of free codes available:</li>
      <ul>
        <li><u>Premade Codes</u> -- These are codes that were previously requested from random users that are fashioned after their character and pushed to be public.</li>
        <li><u>Gifted Codes</u> -- These are codes that are specifically fashioned after your character and aesthetic. Depending on personal relationship and/or previous agreement, these codes may or may not be pushed to be a premade code.</li>
        <li><u>Raffle Codes</u> -- These are layouts that somebody wins by joining and winning a profile raffle. These are not pushed to become public.</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <li>What do I need to commission a code?</li>
    <ul>
      <li>The most basic thing you need are <b>picture/s and budget range.</b> Though I may ask multiple question during the <i>Information Exchange</i>, those two are the most important and is what I'll be asking first. Everything after that will just be consistent communication via Discord or e-mail.</i></li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <li>How long does it usually take for you to finish your code?</li>
    <ul>
      <li><b>It always varies depending on my schedule</b>, so unfortunately, I can't give you a concrete answer for this one.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <li>What is the price of your other services? <i>Photo rendering, profile add ons, etc.</i></li>
      <ul>
        <li><b>They most certainly vary as well.</b> But they are usually around the $2 - $5 dollar range. <b>Note:</b> The higher the complexity, the larger the fee.
      </ul>
    <li>Do you think I missed a question? Feel free to tell me.</li>
  </ol>

  <b><u>More Information:</u></b>
  <p>Commissions are still owned by Ellexide, just bought by the commissioner. Being still my personal property, please do not try to majorly alter these codes without informing me beforehand.</p>
  <p>Credit is also not to be removed. If you want to minimize it to a simple "code by Elle, please do not steal.", please make to retain the copyright link and the link to my website. This protects your code as well as informs other users where to get profile codes, should they want one.</p>
  <h1>Requests</h1>
  <b><u>How to Request:</u></b>
  <ol>
    <li>Contact Elle through <a href="./contact-me.html">this website</a> <i>only.</i></li>
    <li>Greeting and very basic information exchange</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Picture/s</li>
      <li>Your current profile link</li>
      <li>What kind of profile are you think of.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Agreement Stage</li>
  </ol>
  <b><u>More Information:</u></b>
  <p>Coming into contact with me as well as going through the details of your requested profile is <b>not</b> a guarantee that you are getting a profile.</p>
  <p>If I am unable to make or give you a profile, I don't have to explain myself though I will do my best to. I will not leave you high and dry, and instead forward you to other coders that have amazing codes that are both commissioned and free.</p>
  <h1>Raffle Profiles</h1>
  <p>Every so often I hold raffle draws for a teir 1 or teir 2 profile. The <b>qualifications</b> of these raffles are strict therefore if you don't qualify, you are immediately not on the run to get it.</p>
  <p>The qualifications are simple, however, and they vary between raffle promos so if you were not qualified for the last draw, you may be qualified for a future one.</p>
