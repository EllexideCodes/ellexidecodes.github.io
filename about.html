  <h1>About The Coder</h1>
  <div class="imgLeft elle"></div>
  <p>
    Ellexide Codes is run solely by Elle (real name redacted) since late 2017. Before she established a coding front, Elle has had an interest in coding since early 2015 but never had the time to pursue her interest.
  </p>
  <p>
    On June 2016, she was introduced to a website--RPC--that allowed for users to have the freedom to create their own page from scratch. At this point in time, the only thing Elle was familiar with was the most basicaly h1, center tags that was taught in her Junior Year of High School.
  </p>
  <p>
    The fact that almost every user she found in that website had very creative, interactive, and colorful pages piqued her interest. It wasn't like any other website where there was a template you could follow. This gave you a blank page to work with.
  </p>
  <p>
    With a very haphazardly made page, Elle continued to traverse the site looking into where she could get premade templates. As all these sources came into view, she learned the basics by experimenting. But nothing was in depth until December 2016. An old friend, in the name of <i>Bryn</i>, offered to allow them to watch as he coded one of their other friend's pages.
  </p>
  <p>
    Long story short, Elle's interest in coding continued to grow. Not just for CSS and HTML, but JS as well. Sources such as <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/" target="_blank">Codecademy</a> and her significant other, <b>Kevin</b>, helped her continue to learn and grow her skill in programming and web design.
  </p>
  <h1>About E.C. Products</h1>
  <div class="imgRight code"></div>
  <p>All E.C. Layouts are postpaid therefore E.C. does not offer any refunds. That is a risk to the business seeing as files are pre-checked by the commissioners on whether they contented with the profile they are given.</p>
  <p>Commission process is as goes:
    <ul>
      <li>Exchange of information</li>
      <li>Coding Process -- At this point, gifs and photos will be sent to the commissioner to keep them up to date as well as take feedback to change the profile they way they want to.</li>
      <li>Final agreement and payment</li>
      <li>Text files of the codes are forwarded</li>
      <li>7 Day Grace Period -- commissioners can ask for major code changes for upto 7 days after payment</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>Giving refunds will risk E.C. being scammed because the text files could still be kept by the user as well as their money. They may cancel their commission at any point before the Final Agreement and any downpayment they may have given will be fully refunded. After that, there is no money back guarantee.</p>
  <p>
    <b>Customer Support</b> is of high value to Ellexide Codes. Even after the 7 day grace period, there is a lifetime guarantee of bug fixes, minor changes, and minor feature additions. Should there be any major additions, they will be done for a small fee--$2 - $5.
